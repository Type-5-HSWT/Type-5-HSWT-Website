  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>The Irish power system targets 80% renewables by 2030, based mainly on onshore/offshore wind 
    and solar PV generation. High levels of converter-based generation lead to power system stability 
    concerns, but EirGrid, transmission system operator, targets increasing the system non-synchronous 
    penetration (SNSP) limit from 75% to 95%. At present, synchronous condensers are the preferred 
    option to support high SNSP ambitions, as a well-established technology. However, cost 
    considerations encourage more innovative technologies, such as grid-forming converters, but a 
    clear grid-forming definition is lacking, and equipment cost vs. capability considerations remains 
    active research.</p>
     
  </p>Instead, here, Type 5 wind turbines are investigated as a robust and economic solution towards 
    achieving 100% renewables ambitions. Type 5 turbines replace the converter and gearbox of Type 3 
    and 4 wind turbines with a mechanical "hydraulic fluid" transmission, which connects the variable
    speed aerodynamic rotor to a directly grid-connected synchronous machine, such that all the 
    benefits of synchronous machines apply, e.g. high fault current, inertial response. High-fidelity 
    electro-mechanical models of Type 5 wind turbines, and their control systems, will be developed, 
    and their ability to meet grid code (and system service) requirements will be evaluated, in 
    comparison with Type 3 and 4 (converter-based) wind turbines. The implications of large Type 5 
    deployments on fast frequency reserve requirements, and other system services, as well as achieving 
    very high SNSP levels will be assessed. Finally, techno-economic analysis will determine the optimal 
    combination of Type 5 turbines, for reducing reliance on grid-forming converters and synchronous 
    condensers for the future Irish power system.</p>
