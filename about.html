  <h2>About HSWT</h2>
  <p>Type 5 wind turbines use hydrostatic transmission to transmit power from the (variable-speed) turbine 
    rotor to the (fixed-speed) electrical generator, Figure 1(a). This technology offers potential advantages 
    over Type 3 and Type 4 variable-speed wind turbines. Firstly, hydrostatic transmission eliminates the 
    need for a mechanical gearbox and a costly power converter, leading to improved reliability. 
    Additionally, the lighter weight of the hydrostatic transmission enables a more compact wind turbine 
    design, resulting in cost reductions for the nacelle and tower, with the electrical generator potentially 
    being placed on the ground rather than in the nacelle23. With an increasing focus on grid-forming 
    capabilities for (near) 100% renewable ambitions, one very important advantage of Type 5 wind 
    turbines is that they employ a synchronous generator which is directly connected to the grid. 
    Consequently, Type 5 turbines inherently provide an inertial response (without needing additional 
    controls), directly contribute to system strength by providing large short-circuit currents during grid 
    faults, provide synchronising torque and damping, etc., such that they provide the same system 
    support capabilities as conventional (thermal) generation. An additional potential benefit of Type 5 
    wind turbines is that short-term energy storage system, in the form of a hydraulic accumulator, can be 
    incorporated, which enhances their energy management capabilities for reducing mechanical stress, 
    power smoothing, fast frequency response capability24. Furthermore, Type 5 wind turbines can operate 
    in synchronous condenser mode (since they are synchronous machines), allowing them to regulate 
    reactive power and stabilise local voltage levels, even under non-windy conditions. Such capability 
    enhances the ability to support overall grid stability. However, despite the various advantages of Type 
    5 wind turbines over Type 3 and 4 (converter-based) equivalents, there are some disadvantages. 
    Notably, their efficiency is reduced when operating at partial load, but recent advances in fluid power 
    technology, e.g. digital transmission and high-performance fluids, have rekindled interest<p>
