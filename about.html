  <h2>About HSWT</h2>
  <p>The Irish power system targets 80% renewables by 2030, based mainly on onshore/offshore wind 
and solar PV generation. High levels of converter-based generation lead to power system stability 
concerns, but EirGrid, transmission system operator, targets increasing the system non-synchronous 
penetration (SNSP) limit from 75% to 95%. At present, synchronous condensers are the preferred 
option to support high SNSP ambitions, as a well-established technology. However, cost 
considerations encourage more innovative technologies, such as grid-forming converters, but a 
clear grid-forming definition is lacking, and equipment cost vs. capability considerations remains 
active research. 
 
Instead, here, Type 5 wind turbines are investigated as a robust and economic solution towards 
achieving 100% renewables ambitions. Type 5 turbines replace the converter and gearbox of Type 3 
and 4 wind turbines with a mechanical "hydraulic fluid" transmission, which connects the variable
speed aerodynamic rotor to a directly grid-connected synchronous machine, such that all the 
benefits of synchronous machines apply, e.g. high fault current, inertial response. High-fidelity 
electro-mechanical models of Type 5 wind turbines, and their control systems, will be developed, 
and their ability to meet grid code (and system service) requirements will be evaluated, in 
comparison with Type 3 and 4 (converter-based) wind turbines. The implications of large Type 5 
deployments on fast frequency reserve requirements, and other system services, as well as achieving 
very high SNSP levels will be assessed. Finally, techno-economic analysis will determine the optimal 
combination of Type 5 turbines, for reducing reliance on grid-forming converters and synchronous 
condensers for the future Irish power system. </p>
